Total Child Theme
=================

[Child Theme for the Total WordPress theme.](https://wpexplorer-themes.com/total/docs/child-theme/)


### Usage
Simply download the zip and upload the zip (total-child-theme-master.zip) under your WordPress dashboard at Appearance > Themes. Or extract and uplod via FTP at wp-content/themes/.


### Renaming
You can of course rename the zip file so it isn't called total-child-theme-master.zip (you should do this so it makes more sense) and also change the "Theme Name" at the top of the style.css file.


### [Snippets: Load Child Theme style.css After Parent Theme style.css](https://wpexplorer-themes.com/total/snippets/child-css-after-parent-css/)

By default when you use a child theme in WordPress it doesn't actually load he parent CSS file so you generally would add a function to your child theme's functions.php to load the parent CSS file. Now, this results in the parent CSS file loading after the child theme style.css so the parent theme's CSS will take priority. If you want your child theme's style.css file to load after the parent style.css so that your child theme takes priority you can use the following function to enqueue the parent CSS file instead of the default way of loading it.
